The aim of the project was to create a small file transfer system in C using TCP/IP protocols which could transfer files in a local network. The files could be transferred using either TCP connection or UDP connection. The UDP connection was also to be made reliable so that the packets lost during transmission were re-sent and there was no overall packet loss involved, which was supposed to be implemented using checksums.


The details of the project are present in a pdf inside the filesharing directory.
